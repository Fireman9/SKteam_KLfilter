# Proof of Concept: Kalman Filter Algorithm for State of Charge Estimation

## Introduction
The need for accurate State of Charge (SoC) estimation spans various industries, particularly, in our country affecting FPV drone-makers and renewable energy enthusiasts who require precise and reliable battery management systems. Our discussions and interviews with these target groups have highlighted a critical gap in current SoC estimation methods - a lack of accuracy and adaptability, which leads to decreased efficiency and trust in battery-powered systems.

## Project Justification
Through our research, we identified that inaccurate SoC readings lead to suboptimal performance and reduced lifespan of battery systems, particularly impacting:

- **FPV Drone Makers:** Precision in SoC readings is crucial for flight time estimation and safety, impacting the performance and reliability of their products
- **Renewable Energy Enthusiasts:** For those aiming for independent energy systems, accurate SoC is vital for efficient energy storage and utilization, impacting their ability to use stored power reliably. It is necessary in most regions of our country, because of the problems with Ukraine's electricity production. 

The solution lies in improving SoC estimation techniques, directly addressing these pain points, and enhancing system reliability.

## Proposed Solution
We propose to develop a SoC estimation system utilizing the Kalman Filter algorithm. This system will be designed to adapt to various battery types and usage patterns, improving its accuracy and reliability over time. The Kalman Filter is chosen for its effectiveness in estimating states in systems with uncertain variables, making it an ideal choice for real-time SoC estimation.
